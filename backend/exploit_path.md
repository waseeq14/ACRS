1. **Step-by-step exploitation path**
   - Log in as user `alice`.
   - Verify the sudoers entry by executing: `sudo -l`
   - Confirm that `alice` can run `python3.6` as `rabbit` without a password.
   - Execute the following command to spawn a shell as `rabbit`:
     ```
     sudo -u rabbit python3.6 -c 'import os; os.system("/bin/bash")'
     ```
   - This command uses Python to execute a shell command, effectively giving `alice` a shell with `rabbit`'s privileges.

2. **Tools/Commands/Environment setup / requirements (if any)**
   - Ensure Python 3.6 is installed on the system.
   - User `alice` must have the appropriate sudoers entry allowing execution of `python3.6` as `rabbit`.

3. **Affects of the Given vulnerability when exploited**
   - The vulnerability allows `alice` to execute arbitrary commands as `rabbit`, potentially leading to unauthorized access to files and processes owned by `rabbit`.
   - If `rabbit` has higher privileges or access to sensitive data, this could lead to further privilege escalation or data breaches.
