Vulnerability:  
The vulnerability in this test case is an integer overflow in the `verify_password` function. The `check` variable, which is initialized to `0x7FFFFFFF`, can overflow when a large password value is added to it. This overflow can cause the `check` variable to wrap around to a negative value, potentially granting unauthorized admin access.
