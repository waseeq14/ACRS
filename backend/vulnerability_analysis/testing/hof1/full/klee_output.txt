Vulnerability:  
The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `authenticate` function. The `strcpy` function is used to copy user input into a fixed-size buffer without bounds checking, which can lead to an overflow and potentially overwrite adjacent memory, such as the `auth_flag`.

Test Case Name:  
`/home/parrot/Desktop/fyp/backend/vulnerability_analysis/testing/heap_buff_overflow/full/klee-last/test000002.ktest`

Input that triggered it:  
The input that caused the overflow is a 100-byte sequence, primarily consisting of `0x01` followed by a series of `0xff` bytes, which exceeds the allocated buffer size of 8 bytes for both `username` and `password`.

Likely Vulnerable Line(s):  
- Line 34: `strcpy(creds->username, input);`  
- Line 39: `strcpy(creds->password, input);`
