# ret2libc
## Purpose
 The purpose of this section is to explain the ret-to-libc (ret2libc) technique, a method used to exploit buffer overflow vulnerabilities on systems where the stack is protected with the No Execute (NX) bit. This technique bypasses the inability to execute shellcode directly from the stack.

## Overview
The ret2libc technique is applicable primarily to *Unix-like (nix) systems and leverages functions in the libc library, such as system, execve, or puts, to achieve arbitrary code execution.

## Background
In a standard stack-based buffer overflow, an attacker typically:

Writes shellcode (malicious code) into the program's stack.
Redirects execution to the shellcode, allowing control over the vulnerable application.
However, with the NX (No Execute) bit enabled:

The stack is marked as non-executable, preventing the execution of shellcode stored on it.
This security feature is common in modern systems and effectively blocks traditional stack-based buffer overflow attacks.


### To bypass this protection, the ret2libc technique:

- Exploits the buffer overflow to overwrite the return address with the address of a libc function, such as system.
- Provides arguments to the function (e.g., a string like /bin/sh for system) via the stack.
- Redirects execution to trusted code already present in memory (like libc), avoiding the need to execute shellcode from the stack.
- Key Steps in ret2libc Exploitation

### Find a Vulnerable Program:

- Identify a program that is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.
### Locate libc Functions:

- Use tools like objdump or readelf to find the addresses of functions in the libc library (e.g., system, exit, /bin/sh string).
### Craft the Payload:

### Build an exploit payload that:
- Overwrites the return address with the address of a libc function.
- Provides arguments for the function on the stack.
- Optionally chains additional function calls (e.g., call exit after system).

### Exploit the Program:
- Inject the crafted payload into the vulnerable program to gain control.
