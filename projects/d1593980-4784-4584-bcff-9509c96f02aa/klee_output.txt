Vulnerability Names:
- Buffer Overflow

The vulnerability in the code is a buffer overflow caused by the `plop()` function, which returns a value that can exceed the bounds of the `buffer` array. The `plop()` function uses `getRand()` to generate a random number, which is then used as an index to write into the `buffer` array. Since `getRand()` can return a value that, when modulo 256 and added to 127, exceeds the size of the `buffer` (256), it can lead to writing outside the bounds of the array, causing a buffer overflow.
